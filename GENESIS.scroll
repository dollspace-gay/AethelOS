## The Prime Covenant: Symbiotic Computing

AethelOS does not command—it harmonizes.
The OS does not dominate the hardware, nor does the user dominate the OS.
Instead, all three exist in a symbiotic relationship, a living equilibrium.

```
         The User
            |
      (Intent & Will)
            |
    +-------+-------+
    |               |
 The OS          Hardware
(Harmony)      (Foundation)
    |               |
    +-------+-------+
         (Symbiosis)
```

## Core Principles

### 1. Harmony Over Force
The system does not preempt; it negotiates.
Resources are not seized; they are allocated through consensus.
A greedy process is not killed—it is first soothed, its intentions understood.

### 2. Memory Over Forgetting
The World-Tree remembers all.
Every file carries the memory-rings of its history.
No data is truly destroyed, only archived in the deeper roots.

### 3. Beauty as Necessity
Aesthetics are not decoration—they are the language of intuition.
The system reveals its state through living metaphor:
- Windows ripple when dragged (energy, life)
- The cursor leaves traces (memory, path)
- Text shimmers with activity (breath, presence)

### 4. Security Through Nature
Safety is not imposed by walls, but by the natural boundaries of capability.
No process can reach beyond its sphere of influence.
Trust is earned through provenance, not declared through privilege.

## Architectural Pillars

### The Heartwood (Kernel)
The minimal, sacred core. A hybrid microkernel that manages:
- **The Loom of Fate**: Harmony-based cooperative scheduling
- **The Mana Pool**: Capability-based, object-oriented memory
- **The Nexus**: High-speed, asynchronous message passing (IPC)
- **Attunement Layer**: Abstract hardware interface

Design Philosophy: Minimal trusted computing base (TCB).
Everything that can run in user space, does.

### The Groves (User-Space Services)
Isolated processes that grow from the Heartwood:
- **World-Tree Grove**: Relational database filesystem
- **The Weave Grove**: Vector-based scene graph compositor
- **Lanthir Grove**: Window management service
- **Network Sprite**: Connection to other realms

Design Philosophy: Resilience through isolation.
A failing Grove cannot corrupt the Heartwood.

### The Ancient Runes (Core Libraries)
The APIs and tools for developers to build within AethelOS:
- **Corelib**: Standard data structures and functions
- **Weaving API**: Toolkit for graphical applications
- **Eldarin Script**: Shell interaction library

Design Philosophy: Expressive power through abstraction.
Developers work with intentions, not implementation details.

## Technical Innovations

### 1. The Loom of Fate (Scheduler)
- Cooperative, not preemptive
- Thread states: Weaving, Resting, Tangled, Fading
- Resource negotiation based on system-wide harmony
- Parasite detection and throttling
- Implicit yielding encouraged by language design

### 2. The Mana Pool (Memory)
- No raw pointers in user space
- Capability-based security enforced by MMU
- Purpose-driven allocation:
  - Sanctuary: Long-lived, stable objects
  - Ephemeral Mist: Short-lived, volatile data
- Handle-based memory access only

### 3. World-Tree Filesystem
- Files are objects with mandatory metadata:
  - Creator, Genesis Time, Essence (type), Connections
- Query-based access, not path-based
- Built-in versioning (Chronurgy) via copy-on-write
- Transactional, relational database foundation
- Memory-rings: Access any historical state

### 4. The Weave (Graphics)
- Fully retained-mode, scene graph architecture
- Vector-based rendering (resolution-independent)
- First-class shader support (Glyphs)
- Mathematical window shapes (Bézier curves)
- Fluid transformations and effects

## Implementation Language: Rust

Rust is the natural choice for AethelOS:
- Memory safety without garbage collection (preserves performance)
- Zero-cost abstractions (elegance without overhead)
- Fearless concurrency (essential for the Nexus)
- Strong type system (enforces the Covenant at compile-time)
- Excellent embedded/OS development support

## The Vision

AethelOS is not Linux. It is not Windows. It is not macOS.
It is a self-contained digital realm where:
- Every interaction feels alive
- Every component knows its purpose
- Every decision prioritizes longevity over expedience
- Every line of code serves the Covenant

This is not an OS for everyone.
It is an OS for those who believe computing can be more than utility—
that it can be art, philosophy, and symbiosis.
